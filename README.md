# Bagheera
NOTE: Work in progress

Xorg compositor made for high performance and easy modularity.
Planned features include lua configs and user glsl shader support.

### Why?
Picom is slow and old. A proper eyecandy compositor is missing in the ecosystem.
Bagheera will NOT include any effects on its own and will instead prioritize the user to add shaders / extra drawing logic.
